# Bidaf
Question Answering system on squad 2.0 data set.


The model aims at building a simple version of the bidaf [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01603.pdf) . The model i have build uses simple embedding rather than char level embedding provided in the paper. Also this is repo is intended to learn how QA system was approached in the bidaf paper.

This model is higly inspired by the work done by github user **ParikhKadam** and team. The link to the repo is [here](https://github.com/ParikhKadam/bidaf-keras/tree/master/bidaf). 

I will be actively contributing to this repo and make more advancement to this project.

Also I am using Google Colab to run this model on gpu.

Hit me @*parthtandel0594@gmail.com* if you have some suggestion or question. To be honest i am still learning things too, so it would be a good chat for me too.

Will be looking into the BERT paper and model more in the future. Have yet no clue about it.
